# password-homework

I've created the necessary prompts for the user to make their choices
Those choices are stored in an Array called userChoiceArray 
I created a loop to go through that array and randomly select chararacters to place in a final password, but I cant get the loop to work.

I struggled with this process a lot and am having a hard time understading the workings of javascript.

I understand in plain english how this page needs to be structured, but translating that into Javascript is extremely challenging for me at this time.
