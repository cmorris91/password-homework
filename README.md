# password-homework

I've created the necessary prompts for the user to make their choices of password length and possible characters.


All of Those possible choices are stored in an Array called userChoiceArray.

I created a loop to go through that array and randomly select chararacters to place in a final password, that is the length the user chose.

The characters from that loop are placed in a finalPassword array, which I then joined to create a single string with the final characters.

The password value is equal to that string.

This was a very difficult process for me to work through, but in the end I got the password genrator to work correctly.
